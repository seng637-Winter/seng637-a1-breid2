# Introduction

This lab provided an opportunity to try exploratory testing, as well as following a manual testing plan. These are both powerful strategies as the exploratory testing allows for finding bugs like a possible user would. The manual testing plan allows for a more structured and repeatable methodology for testing.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Each member of the team was asked to spend at least 30 minutes using the program, and going through several different functions. This allowed the group members to become familiar with the system, and come across a variety of bugs that a potential user would see. These bugs were each logged so that the developers could work on improving the system.

## Test Type
System Testing: Conducted on the complete, integrated ATM system to evaluate the system's compliance with it's specified functional requirements.

## Scope of Testing
| Module Name | Applicable Roles | Description |
|---|---|---|
| System Startup  | Manager | The ATM manager can turn on the ATM and define the amount of cash in the ATM. The ATM must be configured to establish a connection with the bank.  |
| System Shutdown  | Manager | The ATM manager can shutdown the ATM.  |
| Session  | Customer | A customer can insert their bank card into the ATM and provide their PIN. The customer can perform multiple transactions per session.  |
| Transaction  | Customer | A customer inserts a readable card but ATM system detects the incorrect PIN. ATM system must handle this exception. |
| Withdrawal  | Customer | A customer can choose to withdraw an amount from one of their accounts. The ATM must present the customer with the withdrawn amount in cash.  |
| Deposit  | Customer | A customer can choose to deposit money into one of their accounts via an envelope.  |
| Transfer  | Customer | A customer can choose to transfer money between their accounts.  |
| Inquiry  | Customer | A customer can choose to inquire about any of their accounts.  |
| Invalid PIN Extension  | ATM system | The system will accept the correct PIN entry by the customer after up to three tries.  |

## Test Logistics
### Who Will Test?
Pair testing will be utilized for the testing of the ATM system. The following pairs will test all functionality.

- Pair #1: Benjamin Reid, Carissa Chung
- Pair #2: Braden Tink Christian Valdez Alton Wong 

| Pair # | Functionality |
|---|---|
|1,2 | System Startup |
|1,2 | System Shutdown |
|1,2 | Session |
|1,2 | Transaction |
|1,2 | Withdrawal |
|1,2 | Deposit |
|1,2 | Transfer |
|1,2 | Inquiry |
|1,2 | Invalid PIN Extension |

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

The exploratory testing allowed for coming across bugs like a user would, whereas the manual functional testing is a more systematic approach to verifying all the functions of an application.

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

Since the group members are new to bug reporting, we each had information that we wanted to capture. By reviewing the reports of the other members, we were able to create a standard template that ensured we reported all relevant information. Once this was recorded for each bug, we went through to verify that this was indeed an issue, and that the report was sufficient in capturing the issue.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

The pairs for this testing was a group of 2 and a group of 3 which each went through the testing and reporting, and then combined into a single report. One group member would use the system while the other reviewed, and they were periodically changed to ensure a variety of users were searching for the bugs. Once each pair was satisfied with their findings the results were integrated into a final report. This allowed for more crossover and more testing to ensure as many bugs as possible were caught.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Since we were not familiar with the system at the beginning of testing, it was not always clear what was a bug and what was a feature. For example the $0.10 fee on deposits in that is in v1.1 is a $10 fee in version 1.0. Without the system requirements it is unclear if the fee is actually $10. In addition being able to view the account balance on the savings account might be a limitation of the system permissions rather than a bug, but with more testing, and using v1.1 it became more clear how the system should operate.
